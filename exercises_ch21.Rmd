#### code chunks
1. Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, colour, and
   clarity. Assume you’re writing a report for someone who doesn’t know R, and
   instead of setting echo = FALSE on each chunk, set a global option.

2. Download diamond-sizes.Rmd from
   https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/master/rmarkdown. Add a section that
   describes the largest 20 diamonds, including a table that displays their
   most important attributes.

3. Modify diamonds-sizes.Rmd to use comma() to produce nicely formatted output.
   Also include the percentage of diamonds that are larger than 2.5 carats.

4. Set up a network of chunks where d depends on c and b, and both b and c
   depend on a. Have each chunk print lubridate::now(), set cache = TRUE, then
   verify your understanding of caching.
