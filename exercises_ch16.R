# 1. Describe the difference between is.finite(x) and !is.infin ite(x) .

# 2. Read the source code for dplyr::near() (Hint: to see the source code, drop
# the () ). How does it work?

# 3. A logical vector can take three possible values. How many possi‚Äê ble
# values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can a double
# take? Use Google to do some research.

# 4. Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to
# an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.

# 5. What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string into a
# logical, integer, and double vector?
