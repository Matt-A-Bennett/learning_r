# 1. Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from
# its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables
# would you need to combine?

# 2. I forgot to draw the relationship between weather and air ports . What is
# the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram

# 3. weather only contains information for the origin (NYC) air‐ ports. If it
# contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional
# relation would it define with flights ?

# 4. We know that some days of the year are “special,” and fewer people than
# usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame? What
# would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the existing
# tables?
