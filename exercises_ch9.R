# 1. Using prose, describe how the variables and observations are organized in
# each of the sample tables.

# 2. Compute the rate for table2 , and table4a + table4b . You will need to
# perform four operations: a. Extract the number of TB cases per country per
# year. b. Extract the matching population per country per year. c. Divide
# cases by population, and multiply by 10,000. d. Store back in the appropriate
# place. Which representation is easiest to work with? Which is hardest? Why?

# 3. Re-create the plot showing change in cases over time using table2 instead
# of table1 . What do you need to do first?
